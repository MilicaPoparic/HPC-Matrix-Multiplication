# HPC-Matrix-Multiplication

Implementation of Cannon's algorithm for matrix multiplication.

The sequential version of the algorithm is realized by iteratively executing the steps of the algorithm as in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk-mJcj7y_I&ab_channel=Comrevo

The parallel version of the algorithm is realized by using MPI for Python package.
